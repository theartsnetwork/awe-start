When you browse product x on your favourite e-commerce app (btw mine is Amazon!), it shows a list of â€˜You may also likeâ€™ products. On Snapchat your perfect dog-face selfie looks cute, thanks to A.I. or when you search on large scale search engine (Thatâ€™s Google), a million things happen behind that search bar and among other things artificial Intelligence makes your search experience intuitively better and faster.
