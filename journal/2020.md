# 2020

It’s a start of a new decade. It is 2020 and if you want your brand to win big this year and in the coming decade, you can no longer ask why digital but how digital can help achieve more growth (on internet scale) to your brand. I am listing new and emerging themes in digital marketing in 2020.

## 1. Mobile Customer Experience

![Mobile Customer Experience](/uploads/mobile-experience.png "Experience on mobile is key for brands in 2020")It’s been 10 years since original iPhone. Your customers take customer experience on mobile for granted now as the mobile ecosystem is very advanced. You brand better excel in delivering brand experience there through mobile apps or PWAs or whatever it is called nowadays.

## 2. Audio Skills for the Voice Assistants

Your brand marketing strategy without an audio element inbuilt is like you wanting to be in dating game without being on any online dating app!

## 3. Snackable Video Content

![](/uploads/snack-video.png)Is your brand ready to leverage the tiny videos taking internet by storm? Yeah, I am referring to Tik Tok and the likees of the world. The younger generation can engage with your brand’s edgy side. (off course, if you have one!)

## 4.AR + VR

![](/uploads/ARVR.png)Another big theme is emerging given the development in mobile and internet technologies. AR stands for Augmented Reality and VR stands for Virtual Reality. All the other realities can be derivatives of one or both. If your brand doesn’t take this reality stuff seriously then your customers might move on to new realities.

## 5. Personalisation
